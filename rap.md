### STILL NEED TO ADD LINES ABOUT DELETE, MUTE, and VISUALIZATIONS
### CHARLIE START

Hello everybody thanks for coming to the show,

bout to go ham on this beat with my macbook pro.


Been workin really hard and we’re feeling pretty keen

but hold up, wait a second, let me introduce the team,


We got Angus, Sara, Charlie and Daniela

and we all got a story that we can’t wait to tellya


It started when we wanted to make our own beats,

but we needed something that would play em back on repeat.


Now the makers final project only lasts two weeks

so we put our heads together and the concept’s pretty sweet,


I can go to the site and fire up a brand new loop,

meet my buddies online so we can jam in a group.


Real time live sessions for max collaboration,

chat bar on the right so you can start a conversation.


You can jam with your friends over here or over there,

yo angus that reminds me, can I get a little snare.

### CHARLIE END
### INSTRUMENTAL BREAK (snare is added) - SWITCH
### ANGUS START

Relax- and listen, no need to beg me please,

cause I’m about to tellya bout the dope technologies.


that were used to build this app from a baby to a man, ******

user stories mixed with waffle gave direction and a plan.


web SOCKETS were used for real time interaction,

we linked it up with tone JS to make the music happen,


some modulation mapping of the beats to get em snappin,

but keep in mind that makes up just a itty bitty fraction,


### ANGUS END
### DANIELA START

MADE WITH NODE,

tested so it won’t explode,

css to make it flow,

and express to make it go,
(slight pause)

Loop machine built with MEAN,

minus mongo makes it EAN?

angular to keep it CLEAN,

with a workflow that is LEAN,

### DANIELA END
### SARA START

Our testing game is strong with jasmine karma and protractor,

from red, to green, and finally refactor.


I’d be lying to you if I said there was no struggle,

Mocking sockets on two browsers, it was really a juggle.


Testing sounds on the page - content that you cannot see,

yet coaches keep on yellin' - we must keep to TDD.
 

### SARA END
### CHARLIE START


It’s been 12 weeks at this school and it’s been pretty cool,

and if I don’t stop and say thank you then I’d feel like a fool,


so thank you all - for coming- to see our presentation,

it wouldn’t be enough to say we feel appreciation.


thank you coaches for your guidance to make our fancy apps

And thank you petticoat lane for the katsu wraps.


thank you all alumni helpers at the desk you're the shit,

always got my back to check out my latest commit.


Finally, we can’t express the love we have for our cohort,

trial error and success, with tons of support.


It’s maker’s graduation - and we’re proud to say we made it.

and it’s safe to say that we deserve to go get really faded.

CUT.
