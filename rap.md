### STILL NEED TO ADD LINES ABOUT DELETE, MUTE, and VISUALIZATIONS


Hello everybody thanks for coming to the show,
bout to go ham on this beat with my macbook pro.

Been workin really hard and we’re feeling pretty keen
but hold up, wait a second, let me introduce the team,

We got Angus, Sara, Charlie and Daniela
and we all got a story that we can’t wait to tellya

Once upon a time we wanted to make our own beats,
but we needed something that would play em back on repeat.

now the makers final project only lasts two weeks
so we put our heads together and the concept’s pretty sweet,

I can go to the site and fire up a brand new loop,
meet my buddies online so we can jam in a group.

You can jam with your friends over here or over there,
yo angus that reminds me, can I get a little snare.

### INSTRUMENTAL BREAK (snare is added) - SWITCH

Relax- and listen, no need to beg me please,
cause I’m about to tellya bout the dope technologies.

that were used to build this app from a baby to a man, ******
user stories mixed with waffle gave direction and a plan.

web sockets were used for real time interaction,
we linked it up with tone JS to make the music happen,

some modulation mapping of the beats to get em snappin,
but keep in mind that makes up just a little bitty fraction,

cause it’s made with node,
tested so it won’t explode,
css to make it flow,
and express to make it go,

Loop machine built with MEAN,
minus mongo makes it EAN.
angular to keep it CLEAN,
with a workflow that is LEAN,

Our testing game strong with jasmine, karma, and protractor,
from red to green and finally refactor.

You can jam by yourself or with your homies if you like,
speaking of which-  it’s time to pass the mic.

### SWITCH

Real time live sessions for max collaboration,
chat bar on the right so you can start a conversation.

I’d be lying if I told you that we didn’t face some struggle,
Angular JS turned out to be a juggle.

Testing sounds on the page- content that you cannot see,
yet coaches tell me- we must keep to TDD.

Mocking sockets made it tough to relax,
not to mention Javascript- with callbacks on backs on backs on backs.

It’s been 12 weeks at this school and it’s been pretty cool,
and if I don’t stop and say thank you than I’d feel like a fool,

so thank you all- for coming- to see our presentation,
it wouldn’t be enough to say we feel appreciation.

thank you coaches for your guidance to make our fancy apps
And thank you petticoat lane for the katsu wraps.

thank you all alumni helpers at the desk your the shit,
always got my back to check out my latest commit.

Finally, we can’t express the love we have for our cohort,
trial error and success, with tons of support.

It’s maker’s graduation- and we’re proud to say we made it.
and it’s safe to say that we deserve to go get really faded.

CUT.
